This research explores how childhood socio-emotional development relates to adolescent offending and pathways through which early traits may influence offending into adulthood. The findings have informed discussions with policy stakeholders and third-sector organizations on school behaviour and early intervention, contributing to policy dialogue on early risk identification and supporting the award of follow-on research funding.
